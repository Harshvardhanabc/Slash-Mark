Automatic real-time Auto License Plate Recognizer

Libraries Used:
- OpenCV (cv2)

File Paths:
- Haar Cascade Classifier: "model/haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml"

Variables:
- cap: Video capture object initialized with index 0 (default camera)
- min_area: Minimum area of a detected plate (initialized to 500)
- count: Counter for saving detected plates (initialized to 0)

Main Loop:
1. Capture frames from the camera.
2. Convert frames to grayscale.
3. Detect potential license plates using the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.
4. For each detected plate:
   - Calculate the area of the plate.
   - If the area is greater than the minimum area:
     - Draw a green rectangle around the detected plate.
     - Display the text "Number Plate" above the rectangle.
     - Extract the region of interest (ROI), i.e., the detected plate area.
     - Display the ROI in a separate window titled "ROI".
5. Display the original frame with detected plates outlined.
6. If the 's' key is pressed:
   - Save the ROI of the detected plate as an image file in the "plates" directory.
   - Display a confirmation message on the original frame.
7. Terminate the program if any key (other than 's') is pressed.
