1. It starts by defining an empty list called ‘tasks’. This list will store dictionaries representing tasks, where each dictionary contains details about the task and whether it's completed or not.

2. There are several functions defined:
•	`Dis_task()`: Displays the current tasks in the to-do list.
•	`Add_task(task_details)`: Adds a new task to the to-do list.
•	`mark_complete(task_num)`: Marks a task as completed.
•	`Remove_task(task_num)`: Removes a task from the to-do list.

3. The main program runs in a loop (`while True`) where it presents a menu of options to the user:
•	Option 1: Display the current tasks in the to-do list.
•	Option 2: Add a new task to the to-do list.
•	Option 3: Mark a task as completed.
•	Option 4: Remove a task from the to-do list.
•	Option 5: Quit the program.

4. Based on the user's input, the program executes the corresponding function or quits if the user chooses option 5.

The program allows users to manage their to-do list by adding, marking as completed, and removing tasks interactively through the command line interface.
