This Python code generates random passwords of specified lengths. Let's break down how it works:

1. Import the `random' module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.
2. Define a function `generate_password(passwords_length)` that takes the desired length of the password as input and returns a randomly generated password of that length.
3. Define four lists:
•	`Lower_Alpha`: Contains lowercase letters.
•	`Upper_Alpha`: Contains uppercase letters.
•	`Num`: Contains numbers.
•	`Symbol`: Contains special characters.
4. Concatenate all the lists into one `all_characters` list.
5. Use `random.sample()` to randomly select characters from `all_characters` of length `passwords_length` and join them together to form a password.
6. Prompt the user to input the number of passwords they want to generate (`Number_of_passwords`).
7. Create an empty list `passwords_length` to store the lengths of passwords.
8. Iterate through each password number and prompt the user to input the length of each password. If the length is greater than 3, add it to the `passwords_length` list; otherwise, print a message indicating that the length is not valid.
9. Create an empty list `passwords` to store the generated passwords.
10. Iterate through the lengths of passwords in `passwords_length`, generate a password of each length using the `generate_password()` function, and append it to the `passwords` list.
11. Print each generated password along with its corresponding number.
